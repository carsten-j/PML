Certainly! Here's a revised version of your `weight_function` and `update_loss_squared_history` methods for better readability and performance. I've made the following improvements:

1. **Use of `collections.deque` with `maxlen`**: This efficiently handles maintaining the last 10 values without manually popping elements.
2. **Avoid unnecessary tensor operations inside loops**: Computations are performed using standard Python functions where appropriate, which can be faster than using PyTorch tensors for small-scale operations.
3. **Use of `zip` for looping**: This makes the code cleaner when iterating over multiple sequences.
4. **Simplified condition checks**: Directly checking if the history is non-empty using its truthiness.
5. **Added type hints**: For better readability and to aid static analysis tools.

Here's the updated code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
import torch
import math
from typing import Deque

class YourClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the history with a default deque of maxlen 10 for each new timestep
        self.loss_squared_history: defaultdict[int, Deque[float]] = defaultdict(lambda: deque(maxlen=10))

    def weight_function(self, t: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Importance sampling weight function based on E[L_t^2] using a history.
        """
        t = t.squeeze().long()
        weights = []
        for timestep in t:
            timestep_item = timestep.item()
            history = self.loss_squared_history[timestep_item]
            if history:
                # Compute E[L_t^2] as the mean of the last 10 values
                mean_history = sum(history) / len(history)
                weight = math.sqrt(mean_history)
            else:
                # Default weight if no history is available
                weight = 1.0
            weights.append(weight)
        return torch.tensor(weights, device=t.device)

    def update_loss_squared_history(self, t: torch.Tensor, loss: torch.Tensor) -> None:
        """
        Update the history of L_t^2 for each timestep.
        """
        t = t.squeeze().long()
        # Calculate L_t^2 for the given timesteps
        loss_squared = (loss.mean(dim=1)) ** 2  # Mean over batch dimension
        for timestep, lsq in zip(t, loss_squared):
            timestep_item = timestep.item()
            lsq_value = lsq.item()
            self.loss_squared_history[timestep_item].append(lsq_value)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Initialization with `defaultdict` and `deque`:**
  ```python
  self.loss_squared_history: defaultdict[int, Deque[float]] = defaultdict(lambda: deque(maxlen=10))
  ```
  This setup ensures that each new `timestep` key automatically gets a `deque` with a `maxlen` of 10. When you append more than 10 items, the oldest ones are automatically discarded, eliminating the need for manual management.

- **Efficient Computation in `weight_function`:**
  ```python
  if history:
      mean_history = sum(history) / len(history)
      weight = math.sqrt(mean_history)
  else:
      weight = 1.0
  ```
  - We avoid converting `history` to a tensor inside the loop and instead use built-in Python functions, which are faster for small lists.
  - The `if history` check is more Pythonic and directly checks if the deque is non-empty.

- **Simplified Looping in `update_loss_squared_history`:**
  ```python
  for timestep, lsq in zip(t, loss_squared):
      timestep_item = timestep.item()
      lsq_value = lsq.item()
      self.loss_squared_history[timestep_item].append(lsq_value)
  ```
  Using `zip` makes it clear that we're iterating over pairs of `timestep` and corresponding `loss_squared` values.

**Benefits:**

- **Performance Improvement:** By avoiding unnecessary tensor operations and using efficient data structures like `deque`, the code runs faster, especially when dealing with large numbers of timesteps.
- **Readability:** The code now follows Python best practices, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Maintainability:** Using `defaultdict` and `deque` reduces the amount of code and potential for bugs related to manual list management.

**Note:** Remember to import the necessary modules (`defaultdict`, `deque`, `math`, and `typing.Deque`) at the beginning of your file.
