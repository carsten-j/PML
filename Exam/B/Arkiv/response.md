Find DDPM implementations that *SPECIFICALLY PREDICT MU* HEAR ME: DO NOT FIND SOLUTIONS THAT PREDICT EPSILON

assistant
Certainly! Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can be implemented in various ways depending on what the neural network predicts at each timestep. While many implementations focus on predicting the noise term (epsilon), there are implementations and methods where the model specifically predicts the mean (mu) of the reverse diffusion process.

Below, I've compiled a list of DDPM implementations that specifically predict mu, along with explanations and resources to help you explore these models.

### **1. Original DDPM Implementation by Ho et al.**

**Description:**

The original DDPM paper by Ho et al. presents formulations where the model predicts the mean (mu) directly. Their TensorFlow implementation allows for different parameterizations, including predicting mu.

**Repository:**

- **GitHub:** [hojonathanho/diffusion](https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion)

**Key Details:**

- This implementation is faithful to the original paper.

- It includes options to predict either epsilon or mu.

- You can configure the model to predict mu by adjusting the training objectives.

### **2. Karras et al.'s Improved DDPM**

**Description:**

Karras et al.'s work on improving DDPMs introduces techniques where the model can predict mu. Their methods focus on optimizing the variance schedules and parameterizations for better sample quality.

**Repository:**

- **GitHub:** [NVlabs/edm (Elucidated Diffusion Models)](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm)

**Key Details:**

- Provides an implementation that can predict mu.

- Introduces improved training techniques.

- Suitable for high-fidelity image synthesis tasks.

### **3. Phil Wang's (lucidrains) Denoising Diffusion Implementation**

**Description:**

Phil Wang provides a PyTorch implementation of DDPMs with flexibility in the model's prediction targets. You can configure the implementation to predict mu.

**Repository:**

- **GitHub:** [lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch)

**Key Details:**

- Highly modular and easy to read.

- Supports different prediction parameterizations.

- Allows you to switch between predicting epsilon, mu, or even the original data xâ‚€.

### **4. Yang Song's Score-Based Generative Models**

**Description:**

While focusing on score-based generative modeling, Yang Song's implementation includes methods where the model predicts the score function, which is closely related to predicting mu in continuous formulations.

**Repository:**

- **GitHub:** [yang-song/score_sde_pytorch](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch)

**Key Details:**

- Implements continuous-time diffusion models.

- The score function can be used to derive mu.

- Offers insights into alternative parameterizations.

### **5. DDPM-PyTorch Implementation**

**Description:**

This PyTorch implementation provides a straightforward approach to DDPMs, including options for predicting mu.

**Repository:**

- **GitHub:** [tetici/denoising-diffusion-pytorch](https://github.com/tetici/denoising-diffusion-pytorch)

**Key Details:**

- Simple and educational codebase.

- Easy to modify for predicting mu.

- Good for learning and experimentation.

### **Understanding Predicting Mu vs. Epsilon**

Predicting mu (the mean of the reverse diffusion process) instead of epsilon (the noise term) can have practical benefits:

- **Predicting Mu:**

  - Directly models the mean of the conditional distribution \( p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) \).

  - Can lead to more stable training under certain conditions.

  - May provide better control over the denoising process.

- **Predicting Epsilon:**

  - Models the added noise and is often simpler to implement.

  - Widely used in many implementations due to its effectiveness.

  - The relationship between epsilon and mu is mathematically defined, allowing conversions between them.

### **Modifying Existing Implementations**

If you find an implementation that predicts epsilon but want it to predict mu, you can often modify it with the following steps:

1. **Adjust the Model Output:**

   - Change the neural network's final layer to output mu instead of epsilon.

   - Ensure that the output dimension matches the input data.

2. **Modify the Loss Function:**

   - Update the loss function to compare the predicted mu with the true mu.

   - Use the derivation from the DDPM formulation to compute the true mu.

3. **Update the Training Loop:**

   - Calculate the true mu at each timestep during training.

   - Replace references to epsilon with mu in the training code.

4. **Parameterization Reference:**

   - Refer to the original DDPM paper's Section 3 for equations relating mu and epsilon.

   - Utilize the mathematical relationships to ensure correctness.

### **Summary**

While many DDPM implementations default to predicting epsilon due to its simplicity and effectiveness, there are implementations and methods available where the model predicts the mean (mu) directly. The repositories listed above either support mu prediction out of the box or can be modified to do so with reasonable effort.

By exploring these resources, you should be able to find or adapt a DDPM implementation that fits your requirements for predicting mu specifically. If you need further assistance with any of the implementations or have questions about modifying code, feel free to ask!
