    "Here, $(x - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$ is the Mahalanobis distance, which measures the distance of the point $x$ from the mean $\\mu$ in terms of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Python function, you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_m = x - mean\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computing $(x - \\mu)$:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x_m = x - mean\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This computes the difference vector \\((x - \\mu)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computing $\\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$ using `np.linalg.solve`:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   inv_cov_x_m = np.linalg.solve(covariance, x_m)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The `np.linalg.solve` function solves the linear system $\\Sigma \\cdot y = (x - \\mu)$ for $y$, which effectively computes $y = \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$ without explicitly calculating the inverse of $\\Sigma$. This approach is numerically more stable and efficient than computing the inverse directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computing $(x - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   exponent = inv_cov_x_m.T.dot(x_m)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This computes the dot product $[ \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu) ]^\\top \\cdot (x - \\mu)$, which simplifies to $(x - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$. The reason the transpose is on `inv_cov_x_m` is because `inv_cov_x_m` is already $\\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So although it might look different at first glance, the code effectively computes the Mahalanobis distance $(x - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$, just utilizing `np.linalg.solve` for numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use `np.linalg.solve` instead of directly computing the inverse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the inverse of a matrix explicitly (especially large or ill-conditioned matrices) can lead to numerical inaccuracies and is computationally inefficient. `np.linalg.solve` avoids these issues by solving the system of equations directly, which is more stable and usually faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function computes the multivariate normal PDF correctly. The exponent inside the `np.exp` function corresponds to the Mahalanobis distance, $(x - \\mu)^\\top \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)$, even though it is computed using `np.linalg.solve` for better numerical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `np.linalg.solve(covariance, x_m)` computes Σ⁻¹(x–μ), so the dot product gives (x–μ)ᵗΣ⁻¹(x–μ) as in the standard formula—the function computes the PDF correctly using a numerically stable method."
