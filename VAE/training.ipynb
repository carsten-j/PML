This is a common issue when working with VAEs where the learned variance (`recon_logvar`) leads to high variance (or standard deviation), causing the sampled images to be extremely noisy.\n",

    "**Issue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The learned variance (`recon_logvar`) may be too large, resulting in a high standard deviation (`recon_std`).\n",
    "- When you sample from the Gaussian distribution \\( \\text{recon\\_mu} + \\text{recon\\_std} \\times \\epsilon \\), large values of `recon_std` can introduce significant noise, making the images appear random.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inspect `recon_logvar` and `recon_std` Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Before sampling, print out the statistics of `recon_logvar` and `recon_std` to see if they are reasonable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparing VAEs requires a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. By systematically evaluating each model using the methods outlined above, you can make an informed decision about which model performs better for your specific application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that \"better\" can be subjective and dependent on the context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you prioritize **reconstruction quality**, models with lower reconstruction loss and better visual reconstructions are preferable.\n",
    "- If you value **latent space properties** like disentanglement or smoothness, Beta VAE or models with regularization might be better.\n",
    "- For tasks requiring **classification**, the categorical decoder's performance in predicting labels is crucial.\n",
    "\n",

    "# improvement of loss function for VAE with Bernoulli decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the loss function in your variational autoencoder (VAE) implementation can be improved by utilizing other PyTorch tools, as suggested in the comment in your code. Specifically, you can enhance both the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence term by taking advantage of built-in functions that offer better numerical stability and cleaner implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how you can improve the loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Improve the Reconstruction Loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Current Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(\n",
    "    recon_x, x.view(-1, recon_x.shape[-1]), reduction=\"sum\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issue:** This implementation assumes that `recon_x` is already passed through a sigmoid activation to squash the outputs into the \\((0, 1)\\) range suitable for `binary_cross_entropy`.\n",
    "- **Problem:** Applying the sigmoid activation separately can lead to numerical instability, especially when the inputs have extreme values. Additionally, it requires an extra computation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Improvement: Use `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution:** Instead of applying the sigmoid activation to the decoder outputs (`recon_x`), you can directly use the raw logits and the `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` function.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Combines the sigmoid activation and the binary cross-entropy loss into a single, more numerically stable function.\n",
    "  - Reduces computational steps and potential sources of error.\n",
    "\n",

    "    recon_x, x.view(-1, recon_x.shape[-1]), reduction=\"sum\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notes:**\n",
    "  - Ensure that the decoder's final layer does **not** apply a sigmoid activation.\n",
    "  - The `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` function internally applies the sigmoid activation and computes the binary cross-entropy loss in a numerically stable way.\n",

    "### **2. Improve the KL Divergence Term**\n",

    "- **Issue:** While this computes the KL divergence between the approximate posterior \\( q(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}) \\) and the prior \\( p(\\mathbf{z}) \\) correctly, manually coding the KL divergence can be less transparent and potentially error-prone.\n",
    "- **Problem:** It might not be immediately clear that this term represents the KL divergence between two normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Improvement: Use `torch.distributions` Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution:** Utilize the `torch.distributions` module to define the distributions and compute the KL divergence using the `kl_divergence` function.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Makes the code more readable and expressive.\n",
    "  - Leverages built-in functions that are well-tested and maintained.\n",

    "KLD = kl_divergence(q_z, p_z).sum()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notes:**\n",
    "  - `scale` parameter in `Normal` distribution should be the standard deviation, which is computed as \\( \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\log \\sigma^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\log \\sigma\\right) = \\sigma \\).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Why Use `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`?**\n",

    "- **During Inference:**\n",
    "  - When generating samples from the VAE, apply the sigmoid function to the decoder's output logits to obtain probabilities between 0 and 1.\n",
